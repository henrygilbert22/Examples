Reversere()
    My worst case run time is looping through the list once. Thus my run-time complexity is O(n). 
    This is a linear complexity and this is relfected in the linear progression of my run times. 

Dedeplucate()
    My worst case run time is looping through the list for each node in the list. Thus my run-time 
    complexity is O(n^2). This is reflected in my in my quadratic progression of my run times.
